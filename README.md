### Movie Industry Analysis for Microsoft Studios
This project analyzes the movie industry data to provide insights and recommendations to Microsoft Studios on how to succeed in the movie industry.

### Business Understanding
The goal of this project is to help Microsoft Studios make informed decisions about movie production and distribution. By analyzing the data from various sources such as IMDB and Box Office Mojo, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and factors that contribute to the success of movies.

### Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project includes information on movies such as title, genre, release date, budget, revenue, ratings, and production companies. We used Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the data.

### Data Analysis
We analyzed the data to answer questions such as:

1. What are the top grossing studios in the movie industry?
2. What is the correlation between production budget and box office revenue?
3. When is the best time to release a movie?
4. What are the most popular genres and their average ratings?

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following for Microsoft Studios:

1. Partner with top grossing studios such as BV, Uni, WB Studio, Fox, and Sony.
2. Invest in higher production budgets to increase box office revenue.
3. Release movies in the months of May, June, or July to maximize box office revenue.
4. Consider producing short films, documentary films, and action/adventure films to cater to different audience preferences.
